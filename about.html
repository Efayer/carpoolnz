					Carpooling (also car-sharing, ride-sharing, lift-sharing and covoiturage) is the sharing
					of car journeys so that more than one person travels in cars.
					By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each person's travel costs
					such as fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving. Carpooling is also a more environmentally
					friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces air pollution, carbon emissions,
					traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling,
					especially during periods of high pollution or high fuel prices.
					In 2009, carpooling represented 43.5% of all trips in the United States[1] and 10% of commute trips.
					[2] The majority of carpool commutes (over 60%) are "fam-pools" with family members.[3]

					Drivers and passengers offer and search for journeys through one of the several mediums available.
					After finding a match they contact each other to arrange any details for the journey(s).
					Costs, meeting points and other details like space for luggage are agreed on. They then meet
					and carry out their shared car journey(s) as planned.

					Carpooling is commonly implemented for commuting but is increasingly popular for longer one-off
					journeys, with the formality and regularity of arrangements varying between schemes and journeys.
					Carpooling is not always arranged for the whole length of a journey. Especially on long journeys,
					it is common for passengers to only join for parts of the journey, and give a contribution based
					on the distance that they travel. This gives carpooling extra flexibility, and enables more people
					to share journeys and save money.

					Carpooling usually means to divide the travel expenses in equal parts between all the occupants
					of the vehicle (driver or passenger). The driver doesnâ€™t try to earn money, but to share with
					several people the cost of a trip he would do anyway. The expenses to be divided basically include
					the fuel and possible tolls. But if we include in the calculation the amortization of the vehicle
					purchase and maintenance, insurance and taxes paid by the driver, we get a cost around $1/mile.
					There are platforms that facilitate carpooling by connecting people seeking respectively passengers and drivers.
					Usually there is a fare set up by the car driver and accepted by passengers, because they get an agreement before trip start.
