		<h1>Top six reasons you should Carpool</h1>

		<p>
			SAVE ON GAS- Gas prices are extremely high, and it is a struggle for people to afford to fill those tanks!
			If you carpool with others to get to your destination then you have several people going to the same place,
			which saves on gas! Instead of everyone filling their tanks, only one tank can get everyone there!
</br></br>
			SAFER- Less cars on the road mean fewer accidents, and many places have carpool lanes too. These lanes have
			been proven to be more efficient, and safer! Road trips alone can be dangerous, so carpool with someone going
			the same way and be safer on your trip. Share the expenses too!
</br></br>
			GREAT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT- Less cars on the road means less emissions of dangerous fumes in the air, making
			our atmosphere greener, and safer thanks to your carpool.
</br></br>
			SAVE ON TOLLS/PARKING FEES- If you have to pass through tollbooths, or pay for a parking garage,
			a carpool will save everyone on those fees.
</br></br>
			MORE SOCIAL- With so much technology these days, face-to-face human interaction is at an all time low.
			A carpool offers a great opportunity to be social with an actual human being instead of a commute alone.
</br></br>
			EASIER COMMUTE/LESS TRAFFIC- Commute times could lessen as traffic congestion goes down with less cars on the
			road, so you may get to your destination quicker and spend less time on the road thanks to the carpool.
